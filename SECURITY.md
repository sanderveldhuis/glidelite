## Security

I take the security of my software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed by me, [Sander Veldhuis](https://github.com/sanderveldhuis).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any repository, please report it to me as described below.

A security vulnerability could be a weakness in the logic, such as code, which can be exploited resulting in a negative impact of any kind. Any other definition or interpretation of security vulnerability is valid and should be reported.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

This section will be filled once a dedicated reporting system is set up.

## Preferred Languages

I prefer all communications to be in English.

# Frontend

For frontend development GlideLite relies on [Vite](https://vite.dev/) as builder. When initializing a new project, by default GlideLite uses (but is not limited to) [React](https://react.dev/) as library to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

All frontend code development should be made in the `frontend` directory. Feel free to update your `Vite` configuration at `frontend/vite.config.js` as required.
